## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Was given some design templates for this project and was able to come up with similar designs. In this project I learned more about flexible designs using CSS width and max-width properties.

Also learned about hover and focus states on interactive elements, and how they can be used to improve usability and accessibility of websites.

### Continued development

- CSS Length values
- CSS color values
- CSS pseudo classes

### Useful resources

- Did a recap on basic color and length properties. Checkout these [Getting to know CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/) to take a deeper look on some basic CSS properties.
